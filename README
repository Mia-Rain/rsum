rsum
-- checksums in near pure shell
---
building
-- run `sh ./standalone.sh conf=bindgen.conf > ./rsum.sh`
---- for standalone usage
-- run `sh ./bindgen.sh`
---- to generate functions for 3rd party usage
---
usage
-- ./rsum.sh [FILE] [MODE] [LOOP SIZE]
---- FILE:
------ file to generate checksum for
------ use `-` if piping data
---- MODE:
------ gen mode to use
---- LOOP SIZE
------ sets the value of $max_t
------ smaller numbers result in larger checksums
------ for more info seed ./src/standard
---
Limitations
-- due to the limitations of POSIX shell's integer size limit
---- only 18446744073709551614 factorial possible states exist
---- a file of large enough size could have more possible states
---- thus it is likely that collisions will occur with large files
------ additionally rsum operates on the entire file
------ 40 characters per loop; this can lead to extremely long calculation times
------ for large files

modes
-- currently only a standard mode exists
-- however I have plans for additional modes in the future
